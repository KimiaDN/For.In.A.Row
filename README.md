# For.In.A.Row
This project is a game named "For In A Row".
"For In A Row" is a two-person game and each player has some dots,
any person that puts 4(it's optional) dots in one way (up, down, right, left, horizontal-right, horizontal-left) is the winner,
In this implementation, we designed a game with AI which means that a human player can play the game with a computer,
The main algorithm is a nega-max tree instead of a min-max tree.
